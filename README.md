Snake Game Implementation in Java

Overview:
This project implements a classic Snake game using Java. The game allows players to control a snake, navigate through a game board, eat food to grow in size, and avoid collisions with itself and the boundaries of the board.

Project Structure:
- src/com/snakegame/ : Contains the Java source code files.
- SnakeGame.java : Main class that initializes and runs the game.
- SnakeGamePanel.java : JPanel subclass responsible for rendering the game graphics and handling user input.
- assets/ : Directory for storing any additional game assets (not used in the current implementation).

How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the source files.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
4. Compile and run the `SnakeGame.java` file.

Game Controls:
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will move continuously in the direction specified by the last arrow key pressed.
- Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game board boundaries.
- Eat food (represented by red dots) to increase the snake's length and score.

Features:
- Dynamic rendering of the game board using Java Swing.
- User-controlled snake movement with arrow keys.
- Random generation of food items on the board.
- Collision detection to handle snake-body collisions and boundary collisions.
- Score tracking based on the number of food items eaten.
